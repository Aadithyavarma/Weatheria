# Weatheria

Welcome all to the Weatheria app, a simple weather and geographical details app.

I'm making this app from the scratch and will not be using the previous modules given by coursera in this.

This app will tell you the weather and other geographical details of a place you enter.

It will show you:

* Latitude, 
* Longitude,
* Weather deatils of the place with an extra icon which shows the weather and also tells
if it is day or night at the place,

* Temparature,

* Pressure,

* Humidity

And also a note if the place is already saved in your device.

There is also a spinner in the app from which you can select from the saved locations and
it will show you the current weather conditions along with a note you have saved in the
device about your experience in the place.

You can also save new locations in the device to using the add button to save a location with
a note about the experience you had there. You can view this anytime later to see the weather
details of the place along with the note you have saved.

The main focus of this app is to provide the user a smooth and aesthetically pleasing experience with the UI.
I hope everyone likes and enjoys this app! Thank You.
